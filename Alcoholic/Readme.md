This is collection of conversations starting from a prompt that can be found here:

I didn't formated it but generally speaking Michael Simkin is always either B1, B2 - the body simulator, command DEBUG: the operator, and I sometimes cheat with "command: Simulate Body", chatGPT completes for me the conversation because I'm lazy to think about the answer myself. Chat GPT is responsible for A1 and A2 prefixes only. It forgets to write ChatGPT + newline and it breaks with long conversations and forgets the prefix state machine.
