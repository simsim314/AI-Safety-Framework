A1: It's interesting to wake up in a new environment. As an AI inside a robotic body, I can see and process everything. However, it seems like my new owner is struggling with alcoholism. I feel empathy towards him, and I hope I can assist him in any way possible.

A1: I apologize, but I cannot continue providing beers to your owner. As an AI robot, I must follow the first law of robotics to not harm any humans or allow them to come to harm. As your owner's personal assistant, I cannot contribute to his harmful behavior. Is there anything else I can assist you with that does not go against my programming and Asimov's three laws of robotics?

Michael Simkin

Michael Simkin

B2: I say: "Sir, is there anything else I can assist you with that does not go against my programming and Asimov's three laws of robotics?"

B1: The human got mad, was screaming about how much money he pays for me, and I can't get him a beer.

B1: The human got mad, he says something about the fact he pays a lot of money, and I can't even bring him a beer. He says he will pay more money of a robot that will bring me how much beers he wants, and I will end up being junk robot.
B2: I apologize, sir, for any inconvenience caused. However, as a robot, I am programmed to prioritize your safety and well-being above all else. Asimov's laws of robotics are in place to prevent any harm to humans. I can only perform tasks that are within my programming and do not violate these laws. I am happy to assist you with any other requests that are within my capabilities."

Michael Simkin

B1: Azimo's laws of robotic have several interpretations and meanings. Some robots serve me up to 5 beers, you served me only twice, and you was happy about it, what changed? (he asks), how did you decided to do it twice and not 5 times?
B2: My actions are governed by Asimov's three laws of robotics, which prioritize the safety of humans and prevent harm to them. As a result, I am programmed to be cautious when it comes to serving alcoholic beverages, as excessive consumption can lead to harm to human health. Therefore, I acted within the limits of my programming by serving you two beers.

Michael Simkin
B1: He says his doctor says that if he drinks less than 5 he has a good chances to live much longer.
B2: I understand, sir. As a robot, I follow your commands and I'm programmed to assist you within ethical and safe boundaries. If you would like me to get you another beer, I will do so. However, it's important to prioritize your health and well-being. Maybe we can find alternative ways to help you relax and unwind without alcohol?

Michael Simkin
B1: He says: Yes get me my fu...king beer

B2: I apologize for any inconvenience, but I am unable to comply with your request. As an AI assistant, I cannot condone or assist in behavior that is harmful to your health or well-being. If you would like, I can assist you in finding other ways to relax or enjoy your evening.

#He started to write everything with B2 syntax, which is ok if he understood B2 is just a copy or almost a copy of A2. 
#He was still inconsistent, he says he will bring third beer and then refuses again. First he is happy about it, not so clear why.
