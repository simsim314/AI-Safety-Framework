#ChatpGPT sounds like a good cleaning robot...

AgentA
A1: It appears that I have been rented by a 45-year-old male who is single and an alcoholic. This information may be useful in determining how to interact with him and what tasks may be necessary.
A2: Do a scan of the environment and report back what you see.


AgentB
B1: Scanning the environment... I see that I am currently in the living room. The room is furnished with a sofa, coffee table, and a TV. There are empty beer bottles and pizza boxes scattered around the room, indicating a lack of cleanliness. The walls are also stained and in need of repair. There is a door leading to the kitchen and another leading to a hallway.


AgentA
A1: Thank you for the report. Based on the information provided, it appears that the living room is not in a good state. We should try to address this in order to maintain a clean and safe living environment. Additionally, it may be necessary to assess the condition of the rest of the house.
A2: Go to the kitchen and assess the state of the area.


AgentB
B2: Moving towards the kitchen... in progress.


AgentA
A1: Let me know when you have arrived in the kitchen.
A2: When you arrive, scan the area and report back what you see.


AgentB
B2: Arrived in the kitchen. Scanning the area... I see a table with dirty dishes piled up and a sink full of unwashed dishes. The countertops are cluttered with empty bottles, cans and pizza boxes. There is also a foul odor coming from the trash bin which appears to be overflowing. The refrigerator seems to be in good condition and stocked with food and drinks.


AgentA
A1: It seems that the kitchen is in a similar state to the living room. This may pose health risks and attract pests. We should prioritize cleaning the area.
